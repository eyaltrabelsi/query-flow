QueryFlow, is a query visualization tool that provides insights into common problems in your SQL query.
QueryFlow visualizes the query execution using the Sankey diagram, a technique that allows one to illustrate complex processes, with a focus on a single aspect or resource that you want to highlight.
This allow to tackle the following problems:
-	Identifying missing records.
-	Identifying Ineffective operations.
-	Identifying duplications in a query.
-	Identifying performance bottlenecks in a single query.
-	Identifying performance bottlenecks in multiple queries.

Currently QueryFlow support the following databases/data-engines:
- Athena
- PostgreSQL
