    "**Slow queries are common and can be caused by various reasons. This makes optimizing queries extremely hard. The main reason multi-queries optimization is even harder is that one query may affect the other. Thus, it is critical to make sure that we take other queries into consideration.** \n",
    "\n",
    "Using QueryFlow we can visualize the queries’ sub-expressions characteristics. Since the execution time of a sub-expression can be caused by several reasons, we might need to visualize the cardinality (actual_rows), duration (actual_duration), and other statistics like whether the operation spilled to disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use QueryFlow as is and visualize two separate Sankies for each of our queries. But we can make it even easier if we construct one Sankey for multiple queries. To do so we need to modify both the parsing and the visualization algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the parsing algorithm, we add a step that checks if a sub-expression was already seen and assigns the current sub-expression with that expression id. To make this possible instead of calculating the node id as an incremental integer, we use a hash function on operation_type, label, and label_metadata. This allows us to see our queries in a compact form as our sub-expressions “share” nodes. The modification for the algorithm can be seen in figure 50.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make differentiating the two queries, we assign each query its color. There is no change required in the enrichment algorithm, as this is done in the visualization phase. The algorithm calculates the hue (color) for each metric in step 5 and then modifies each rows’ hue according to its corresponding metric. The modification for the visualization algorithm can be seen in figure 51\n",
