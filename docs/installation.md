# Installation

## Stable release

To install query-flow, run this command in your
terminal:

```
$ pip install query-flow
```

This is the preferred method to install query-flow, as it will always install the most recent stable release.

If you don't have [pip][] installed, this [Python installation guide][]
can guide you through the process.

## From source

The source for query-flow can be downloaded from
the [Github repo][].

You can either clone the public repository:

```
$ git clone git://github.com/eyaltrabelsi/query-flow
```

Or download the [tarball][]:

```
$ curl -OJL https://github.com/eyaltrabelsi/query-flow/tarball/master
```

Once you have a copy of the source, you can install it with:

```
$ pip install .
```
